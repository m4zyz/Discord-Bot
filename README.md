This is a simple bot you can invite to your discord.

if you don't have an ide i recommend pycharm by jetbrains

when you paste your code in the ide you need to download some stuff first. so head to your terminal in your ide, and type this "pip install discord". After that is downloaded type this "pip install asyncio" and "pip install itertools"

if you need help just make a comment in issues and i will try to get back to you asap.

i will me glad if you leave the credit command.

steps:

make a discord develepor.
make a new application.
go to bot and click to "create" at reveal token. make sure you don't show your token to anybody if you don't trust them.
go to your code and paste it in at the bottom where it says "client.run"
after that go into OAuth2 agian and go to scopes and press on "bot"
scroll a bit down and select the "Administrator"
scoll up and press "copy" there should be a link
paste it into a new tab and invite your bot to your server
go to your code and edit the places where it says you can change the stuff.
now you should be all set and have a discord bot up and running
